Sleep Health and Lifestyle 

**Project Description**

In today's fast-paced and technology-driven society, sleep disorders and insufficient sleep have become increasingly prevalent. Factors such as work-related stress, age, gender, and health metrics can have profound effects on sleep quality, making it critical for individuals seeking to enhance their sleep habits and for healthcare professionals working to address sleep-related health issues.
Sleep is a fundamental aspect of human health and well-being, playing a vital role in our physical, mental, and emotional functioning. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence sleep quality is of significant importance. This data analysis project delves into the relationship between sleep quality and various lifestyle. The analysis aims to uncover insights that can contribute to improved sleep patterns and overall health.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project was “Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset” and can be found on Kaggle.

**Cleaning Process**
The dataset underwent basic cleaning in Excel to ensure it was in a suitable format for analysis. Cleaning steps involved addressing missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and other data quality issues.

**Data Analysis Tools*
This project includes SQL queries done in BigQuery to extract and analyze data. It also includes visual representations done in Tableau.

**Insights**
A normal BMI is associated with longer and better sleep. Overweight and obese individuals have similar average sleep durations, suggesting that weight doesn't necessarily affect sleep duration. There is a significant correlation between BMI and blood pressure, and BMI is also related to heart rate, with higher BMI indicating higher heart rates.
Sleep Health and Age Groups
Sleep duration and quality vary significantly across age groups. Middle-aged adults between 35-44 and 45-54 exhibit the same average for both parameters, indicating consistent sleep health within these groups. In contrast, the youngest age group, 27-34, has the lowest average in both parameters, suggesting a poorer sleep routine and health among this demographic. On the other hand, the older age group, 55-59, demonstrates the highest average in both parameters, implying a better sleep routine and health in this age group

Sleep Disorders and Other Variables 
Sleep disorders are influenced by various factors such as age, gender, and stress levels. In this dataset, it is evident that insomnia tends to affect males with higher stress levels, while sleep apnea is more common among older females. Notably, higher stress levels seem to correlate with a reduced likelihood of reporting no sleep disorder, especially in males. These findings emphasize the intricate interplay of sleep disorders with demographic and stress-related variables.

Stress Level and Health Metrics
The correlation between stress levels and blood pressure is relatively weak. In contrast, stress levels and heart rate show a stronger and significant relationship due to the 'fight or flight' response triggering increased heart rate.
